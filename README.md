## About

I created a mood tracking app as a part of my fullstack certification. While the requirements of the project was important to the curriculum and certainly taught me a lot, I don't believe it's a good fit for this project anymore. I'm not trying to work in JQuery anymore ^\_^'

I'm rebuilding using Preact and Firestore.

## Getting Started

- `npm run dev` - Starts a dev server at http://localhost:5173/

- `npm run build` - Builds for production, emitting to `dist/`

- `npm run preview` - Starts a server at http://localhost:4173/ to test production build locally
